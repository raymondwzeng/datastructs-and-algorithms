# Raymond's Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Hello, this is a GitHub repo started in my freshman year as a Computer Science major at the University of California, Riverside (UCR).

I recently received an email from Google - one of my dream companies to work at - with a phone interview for the STEP Internship (for Freshmen/Sophomores).

As such, I decided to prepare as best as I could in the 2-ish weeks. This repository is part of that preparation.

## What's in the boxâ„¢?

Well, anything and everything should be included, from basic concepts all the way up to some of the more hardcore things.
I might also include Leetcode solutions down the line, walking through each and explaining in detail why they are the way they are.

I hope that you find some value out of it, and I encourage you to fork or make your own repository to implement your knowledge, because after all...

knowledge without application is irrelevant.
